# Using the language you’re most comfortable with, write a function called “simplify” that takes a single parameter: An array of integers.
# Your function should return a new array that is sorted (in ascending order), with all duplicates removed:
# So for instance, if I passed in:
# [0, 9, 8, 3, 3, 3, 5, 9, 5, 0]

# Your function would return:
# [0, 3, 5, 8, 9]

# Notes:
# 1) We assume your language has function that can sort an array. If it doesn’t, just pretend it does. We don’t expect you to write a sort algorithm. If you’re lucky enough to use a language has a built-in way to remove duplicates, please don’t use that. We’d like to see you write that part out.
# 2) Clarity of your code is more important than raw typing speed. So, refactoring to improve your solution is just fine. We don’t anticipate this taking you more than 5 or 10 minutes.
